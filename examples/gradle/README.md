# Better Stack Gradle example

* Get your source token at [Better Stack -> Sources](http://logs.betterstack.com/team/0/sources).
* Edit [src/main/resources/logback.xml](src/main/resources/logback.xml) and replace `<!-- YOUR SOURCE TOKEN -->` with your source token.
* Run `gradle run` from this directory.
* You should see a `Hello World!` log along with a few other examples in [Better Stack -> Live tail](https://logs.betterstack.com/team/0/tail).
